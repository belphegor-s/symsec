# SymSec

SymSec is a cryptographic utility for sealing and unsealing JSON objects using symmetric key encryption with message integrity verification in Node.js. This utility provides a simple and secure way to encrypt sensitive data in a JSON object and verify its integrity, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with in transit or storage. It uses the AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm, which provides strong encryption and authentication of the data, and generates a random initialization vector for each encryption to further enhance security.
